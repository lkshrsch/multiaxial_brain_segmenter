This branch is for development of significant upgrades:

1) Preprocessing makes sure all final resolutions are isotropic (1mm), shape 256x256x256 and orientation RAS
2) Coordinates are generated which are centered at the anterior commissure. This is done using as input a spreadsheet with manually annotated coordinates.
