## Multiaxial Full-Head Segmentation 

Multiaxial is a 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained for full-head segmentation of head MRI into seven classes:
Gray Matter, White Matter, Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF), Bone, Air Cavities, Skin, Background

The model utilizes three 2D CNNs, each operating in a different anatomical plane: Sagittal, Axial and Coronal
A consensus segmentation is then generated by combining these three directional outputs using a 3D CNN.

A DOI will be added once the paper is published (currently in review).
